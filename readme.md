# Deep Learning NLU Project

This is a site documenting my solution to Prof. Vu's deep learning coding challenge at University of Stuttgart in 2020/21.

I used the open source chatbot framwork [rasa](rasa.com) to build the NLU pipeline. See [docs](https://valeknappich.github.io/DL-Coding-Task-rasa/) for more details.
